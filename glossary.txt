Glossary of Terms:

model:
A two dimensional space where positions are represented by real numbers, (x,y). Contains a list of all model_objects in the model.

model_entity:
Represents any physical object in the model. They don't necessarily have to represent material objects, at the very least must have a position in 2-space for the model.

model_object_obstacle:
A model_object that does not need to move.

model_object_mobile:
A model_object that has velocity. Likely in the form of components in x and y directions. May also have momentum, and acceleration, but only to make changes in velocity appear smooth.

view:
The view implementation of a model. This is responsible for displaying view_objects to the display.

view_entity:
The view implementation of a model_entity. Contains a spritesheet and the information to display the model_object's various states.

Note:
all view_objects are coupled to a model_object, but not all model_objects are coupled to a view_object.
